# odin-recipes

The purpose of this project was to create a basic website, with an index page that was linked to 3 different recipes when you clicked on them. Each recipe page was made up of 3 sections: Description, Ingredients, and Steps.

Through this project, I was able to cement several of the skills I learnt in the HTML Foundations section of TOP. These include the boilerplate which is fundamental to any website, several elements and what each can do, using attributes to modify elements, making both ordered and unordered lists, using links and images for your webpage, creating repositories at the beginning of my project, and finally, how to make commit messages with git.
